# flush. (Xiang Yu & Jin Wen)
flush. is a wesbite that hat sells toilet related products and offers a wide range of items to customers who are looking to improve their bathroom experience. This website provides an easy and convenient shopping platform for individuals who are searching for innovative and high-quality products that can enhance their toilets. 

Additionally, this website goes beyond just selling products, by offering a unique and fun way for customers to engage with the site. It features a game component, where customers can earn points by playing a "Wordle" game daily. These points can then be redeemed for discounts, special offers, and even free products. This gamification aspect of the website not only adds an extra layer of excitement for customers, but also encourages them to stay engaged and connected to the site.
## Design Process
* As a user seeking to purchase toilet products, I would prefer a website that is easily accessible at any time, enabling me to buy the desired items with ease. This would allow me to receive the products at my convenience, without the hassle of leaving my home.

* As a user who enjoys an element of fun when shopping, I would appreciate a website that incorporates a game feature, where I can play and earn points that can be redeemed for rewards such as discounts. This would enhance my shopping experience, making browsing the website even more enjoyable, as I know there are always opportunities to earn rewards.

* As a user interested in learning more about the website and its credibility, I would prefer a site with an "About Us" page that provides information on its history, services, and the team behind it all. This would enable me to gain a deeper understanding of the company and its offerings, allowing me to make more informed decisions when considering its services.
